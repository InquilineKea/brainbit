# Genes Potentially Affected by Structural Variants
# This is a preliminary analysis and requires further validation
# Chromosome | Start | End | SV Type | Length | Gene/Region (if known)
# Note: Gene annotation requires additional reference data
# Future enhancement: Integrate with gene annotation databases
