# FOXO3 Gene Analysis
Generated: Sun Mar  2 10:13:37 EST 2025

## Background
FOXO3 (Forkhead Box O3) is a transcription factor that plays important roles in:
- Regulating longevity and aging
- Stress resistance
- Cell cycle regulation
- Apoptosis
- Autophagy
- Metabolism

Variants in FOXO3 have been associated with increased human longevity in multiple populations.
