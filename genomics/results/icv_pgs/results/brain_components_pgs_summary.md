## Polygenic Scores by Brain Component

| Brain Component | Polygenic Score | SNPs Found | Total SNPs | % SNPs Found |
|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|-------------|

## Interpretation

The polygenic scores represent your genetic predisposition for the size of each brain component.
Higher scores suggest a genetic tendency toward larger volumes for that brain component.

### Your Brain Size Profile

Based on your genetic variants, you may have:
