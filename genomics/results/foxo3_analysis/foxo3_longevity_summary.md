# FOXO3 Longevity Analysis Summary

Generated: Sun Mar  2 10:17:23 EST 2025

## Background
FOXO3 (Forkhead Box O3) is a transcription factor that plays important roles in regulating longevity, stress resistance, and metabolism. Variants in FOXO3 have been associated with increased human longevity in multiple populations.

## Longevity Score
Your FOXO3 longevity score: 0.00 out of 1.20 (0.0%)

### Missing Beneficial Variants
* rs2802292: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.25)
  - Increased longevity
* rs2764264: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.20)
  - Increased longevity
* rs13217795: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.15)
  - Increased longevity
* rs1935949: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.15)
  - Increased longevity
* rs4946935: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.20)
  - Increased longevity
* rs9400239: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.15)
  - Increased longevity
* rs479744: Not found in your genome data (weight: 0.10)
  - Increased longevity

### Non-Beneficial Alleles
* None - you have all the beneficial alleles for known longevity variants

## Potentially Damaging Variants
* No known damaging FOXO3 variants were found in your genome (good)

## Interpretation
Your FOXO3 genetic profile is less favorable for longevity based on currently known variants. You're missing most of the beneficial alleles associated with increased lifespan.

## Recommendations
While genetics play a role in longevity, lifestyle factors are equally if not more important. Consider:

1. Regular physical activity
2. Balanced nutrition with adequate protein and plant-based foods
3. Stress management techniques
4. Adequate sleep
5. Social connections

## Limitations
This analysis is based on currently known variants and may not be comprehensive. Many variants have unknown effects, and the impact of specific combinations of variants is not well understood. This information is for research purposes only and should not be used for medical decisions.
