# Detailed Analysis of Key Genes with Insertions

## SHANK2 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2)

### Gene Information

**Function**: SHANK2 is a scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. It plays a crucial role in synapse formation and function by connecting neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and other membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways.

**Clinical Significance**: Mutations in SHANK2 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Studies have found that SHANK2 deletions and mutations can lead to synaptic dysfunction, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Expression Pattern**: Primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. It is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues.

**Protein Interactions**: Interacts with glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA receptors), metabotropic glutamate receptors, and various cytoskeletal proteins. It forms complexes with other SHANK family proteins (SHANK1 and SHANK3) and PSD proteins like Homer and GKAP/SAPAP.

### Insertion Summary

**Total insertions**: 1
**Homozygous insertions**: 1
**Heterozygous insertions**: 0

### Insertion Details

| Position | Length | Genotype | Location | Exon Number |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| 70803361 | 474 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |

### Potential Functional Impact

SHANK2 is a critical scaffolding protein in excitatory synapses that helps organize postsynaptic density. Your insertions appear to be in intronic regions, which may have less direct impact on protein function but could potentially affect splicing, expression levels, or regulatory mechanisms of the gene.

Given SHANK2's strong association with autism spectrum disorders, these insertions warrant further investigation to determine their specific effects on protein function and neuronal development.


## SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3)

### Gene Information

**Function**: SHANK3 is a master scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. It is critical for proper synapse formation, maturation, and function. SHANK3 connects various synaptic proteins and signaling molecules to the actin cytoskeleton.

**Clinical Significance**: SHANK3 mutations and deletions are strongly associated with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability. It is considered one of the most reliably replicated autism risk genes, with mutations found in approximately 1% of individuals with autism.

**Expression Pattern**: Highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Also expressed in the heart and some other tissues.

**Protein Interactions**: Forms complexes with numerous synaptic proteins including glutamate receptors, Homer proteins, Cortactin, and other cytoskeletal elements. It is essential for maintaining the structure and function of dendritic spines.

### Insertion Summary

**Total insertions**: 1
**Homozygous insertions**: 1
**Heterozygous insertions**: 0

### Insertion Details

| Position | Length | Genotype | Location | Exon Number |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| 50697540 | 182 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |

### Potential Functional Impact

SHANK3 is one of the most reliably replicated autism risk genes, with mutations found in approximately 1% of individuals with autism. Your insertions appear to be in intronic regions, which may have less direct impact on protein function but could potentially affect splicing, expression levels, or regulatory mechanisms of the gene.

Given SHANK3's critical role in synapse formation and its strong association with autism spectrum disorders and Phelan-McDermid syndrome, these insertions warrant careful consideration for their potential impact on neurological function.


## CNTN4 (Contactin 4)

### Gene Information

**Function**: CNTN4 is a member of the contactin family of neural cell adhesion molecules. It plays important roles in axon guidance, neuronal network formation, and the development of functional neural circuits.

**Clinical Significance**: Deletions, duplications, and mutations in CNTN4 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders, developmental delay, and 3p deletion syndrome. It is considered a significant risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Expression Pattern**: Primarily expressed in the developing and adult nervous system, particularly in specific subsets of neurons in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory system.

**Protein Interactions**: Interacts with other cell adhesion molecules and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases to mediate cell surface interactions during neural development and circuit formation.

### Insertion Summary

**Total insertions**: 4
**Homozygous insertions**: 2
**Heterozygous insertions**: 2

### Insertion Details

| Position | Length | Genotype | Location | Exon Number |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| 2129413 | 361 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 2263833 | 222 | 0/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 2340705 | 155 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 2920320 | 315 | 0/1 | Unknown | N/A |

### Potential Functional Impact

CNTN4 plays important roles in axon guidance and the formation of neural circuits. Your insertions appear to be in intronic or regulatory regions, which may affect gene expression patterns or splicing rather than directly altering protein structure.

Multiple insertions in CNTN4 (you have 4) could have cumulative effects on gene function. Given CNTN4's association with autism spectrum disorders and 3p deletion syndrome, these insertions may have implications for neurodevelopmental processes and potentially contribute to neurological phenotypes.


## PTPRN2 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type N2)

### Gene Information

**Function**: PTPRN2 (also known as IA-2β or phogrin) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. Despite its name, it lacks phosphatase activity. It is a transmembrane protein primarily found in dense-core secretory vesicles and plays a role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.

**Clinical Significance**: Variants in PTPRN2 have been associated with type 1 diabetes as it is a major autoantigen in this condition. Some studies have also suggested potential links to neuropsychiatric conditions, though these associations are less well-established than its role in diabetes.

**Expression Pattern**: Primarily expressed in neuroendocrine cells, including pancreatic islet cells, pituitary, and adrenal gland. Also expressed in certain neurons in the brain.

**Protein Interactions**: Involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Interacts with components of the SNARE complex and other proteins involved in vesicle docking and fusion.

### Insertion Summary

**Total insertions**: 5
**Homozygous insertions**: 4
**Heterozygous insertions**: 1

### Insertion Details

| Position | Length | Genotype | Location | Exon Number |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| 157656080 | 353 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 158048702 | 528 | 0/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 158049076 | 336 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 158049076 | 363 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |
| 158387515 | 222 | 1/1 | Unknown | N/A |

### Potential Functional Impact

PTPRN2 is involved in secretory vesicle function and is particularly important in neuroendocrine cells. Your insertions appear to be in intronic or regulatory regions, which may affect gene expression patterns or splicing rather than directly altering protein structure.

Multiple insertions in PTPRN2 (you have 5) could have cumulative effects on gene function. While PTPRN2 is primarily known for its role in diabetes as an autoantigen, it also functions in the brain, and these insertions could potentially influence both metabolic and neurological processes.
