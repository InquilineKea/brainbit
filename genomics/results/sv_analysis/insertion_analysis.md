## Potential Functional Impact

To determine the functional impact of these insertions, further analysis is needed:

1. Annotation with gene coordinates to identify insertions within or near genes
2. Analysis of insertion content for potential regulatory elements
3. Comparison with known disease-associated variants
4. Evaluation of evolutionary conservation at insertion sites

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with gene annotation data to identify potentially functional variants
2. Perform comparative analysis with population databases
3. Validate selected insertions with alternative methods
4. Investigate potential phenotypic associations
